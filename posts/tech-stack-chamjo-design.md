title: Tech Stack inside Chamjo Design
date: 2021-12-07
excerpt: How we built Chamjo MVP in just 2 weeks by choosing the right technology stack - React, Tailwind, Node.js, and Express.
---

In August 2021 we decided to initiate and execute the ideas by starting with an MVP. In September 2021, we proudly launch our first MVP. The thing to know is that The Tech team made **Chamjo** by chasing airtime **for 2 weeks**, how do we **solve** it? That can happen because we have to choose the right technology stack.

## Tech Stack

Using the right technology stack will really help us reduce our workload. And of course, we think carefully about what technology we should use. In the case of Chamjo, the technology used for Frontend is we are using [**React Js**](https://reactjs.org/), and [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com) helps us to beautify CSS. And then we use [**Node Js**](https://nodejs.org), and [**Express js**](https://expressjs.com/) as Backend.

### [**React Js**](https://reactjs.org/)

Why did we choose React JS? The first reason is that our team is React Addict 😂, just kidding. That's because React JS makes it easy to build in terms of interface, and of course very easy to use(I Lied 😂). React Js is a very popular Javascript library, there's no denying that we use React because of the huge community. By the command `npx create-react-app chamjo` we can solve it in 2 weeks.

### [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/)

There are many design rules in Chamjo, so Tailwind is the correct answer for this case. With Tailwind, we are very spoiled to modify the style settings. When changing the configuration we only need to call the class and that saves a lot of time. y'all should check this one <https://tailwindcss.com>

and a lil tips from me:

> completes the configuration, and if there are additional style configurations in the middle of development, you will have to wait a bit to compile the configuration.😂

### [**Node Js**](https://nodejs.org) **&** [**Express Js**](https://expressjs.com/)

On the backend side, we use **Node Js** and **Express Js** as **Chamjo** data support. As you know, we don't really have a lot of backend experience 😂. And that is what drives us to learn new knowledge. And if you are a beginner, node js is highly recommended for the backend side. I think in the next stories I will make *how we make backend in Chamjo?* hmm…Interesting
